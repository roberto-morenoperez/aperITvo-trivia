## Welcome to aperITvo-trivia!!

Our company is very proud of have been lunched our reliable and fun trivia game. Ok, it is not the most interactive one and there is some room for improvement in the test coverage but, so far, the clients are happy.

Based on the consumers' feedback, our lovely business directors have committed to rise the trivia level. You have been selected to add some small features

But first lets dive into our successful application: 3 players, Chet, Pat and Sue (so far no one notice that those players are hardcoded and can not change), will fight for the "smartest-guy-on-earth throne" in our trivia game. First to get right 6 questions wins. On their turn, every player throws a die and move that number of tails in the board to decide which type of question has to answer (Pop, Science, Sports and Rock). Our product owner noticed that people didn't care about the question/responses, so we simplified the game by just randomly decide if the question is wright or not, this way you can just go straight to the result and celebrate. Therefore, you though that this was an intelligence game but is, indeed, a luck game, like life! What a twist! Isn't it smart?

## aperITvo-trivia v2

As we said before, we have collected some feedback, now we have some features to implement in our backlog. Here is the list:

- Configurable question topics (add Art questions, remove unwanted topics, set of custom thematic topics set like The Lord of the Rings...)
- Change card pool (distribution, dealing, refreshing if the deck is empty, chose specific questions by name...)
- Change the board shape (circular, jumps between tiles, crossed...)
- Change movement engine (roll dice with different sides , fixed amount... )
- Change the questions resolution (free response, multiple options, random...)
- Change game rules (if player answer correctly repeats, win conditions...)
- Adding history and undo action
- Adding saving option

Our product-owner is on vacation so we can implement the one that we like the most. Some tickets are not super clear with the requirements, therefore we can use our imagination
